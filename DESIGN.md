## Concept 10: Lingua Perdita

**Constraints**: Incremental + linguistics/translation | Unfolding complexity (day 1 trivially simple) | Curiosity/discovery

**Pitch**: You're a scholar deciphering a dead language from fragmentary inscriptions, where each translated word accelerates your ability to translate the next — and the texts tell a story that changes what you think you're translating.

**Core Loop**: You start with a single stone tablet and a handful of known cognates (words similar to known languages). Clicking a word generates **Insight** (primary currency) as you study it. Spend Insight to: (1) purchase **Decipherment Tools** (dictionaries, grammars, comparative texts) that multiply Insight production, (2) attempt **Translations** of unknown words (each is an Element with a cost in Insight), and (3) unlock new **Texts** (inscriptions, scrolls, tablets) that contain new unknown words but also increase passive Insight generation from their known-word content.

The unfolding: Day 1, you're just clicking words on a single tablet, and the only mechanic is "generate Insight, buy dictionary." But translated words form **Roots** — shared linguistic patterns. Discovering a Root (milestone) gives you a blanket discount on translating all words that share it. Then you discover **Grammar Rules** that let you predict word meanings before translating them (reducing cost). Then you discover **Dialects** that branch the language into regional variants, each with unique vocabulary. By endgame, you have a complete grammar and lexicon and can read the texts fluently.

The narrative hook: the texts tell a story. Early tablets are mundane (trade records, prayers). Mid-game texts are historical (war accounts, treaties). Late-game texts reveal the language's speakers knew something about the site of your excavation that changes the meaning of everything you've translated so far — requiring re-translation of early texts with new context, which itself unlocks the final chapter.

**Why It's Interesting**: Linguistics has never been gamified as an incremental. The "each word makes the next easier" loop IS the incremental loop — language learning is inherently exponential (vocabulary compounds). The narrative twist creates a reason to revisit early content, and the "dead language" framing means the player can't cheat by Googling. Discovery of each new root/rule is a genuine "aha!" moment.

**Prestige Design**: Prestige = "New Excavation Season." You move to a new dig site with texts in a related but distinct dialect. Your word translations reset (new words in the new dialect), but you keep your **Rosetta Fragments** (prestige currency = total words translated + roots discovered). Rosetta Fragments buy: (1) GLOBAL_MULT on Insight ("practiced eye"), (2) **Cognate Banks** — words from your previous dialect that share roots with the new one, giving you a head start on translation, and (3) **Analytical Methods** — new decipherment mechanics per excavation.

Excavation 1: basic logographic translation (each word = one symbol). Excavation 2: introduces syllabic writing (symbols represent sounds, not meanings — fundamentally different decoding strategy). Excavation 3: introduces encoded texts (the language's speakers deliberately encrypted sensitive passages). Each excavation's dialect contributes to understanding a proto-language, and completing all three lets you read the Ur-text that ties the narrative together.

**Dev Feasibility**: ~30-35 elements (dictionaries, texts, translated words as milestone-elements, grammar rules), 2 currencies (Insight, Rosetta Fragments), 3 prestige layers. Texts and words can be procedurally generated from a constructed language seed. 2-3 weeks for grey-box (the conlang work is front-loaded design, not code).

**Engine Fit**: Each Text is an Element with PRODUCTION_FLAT on Insight (proportional to known-word count in that text, tracked by Subsystem). Translated Words are max_count=1 Elements with varied costs. Roots are Milestones that trigger COST_MULT effects (reducing translation costs for related words). Grammar Rules are Elements with PRODUCTION_MULT on Insight. Dictionaries/tools are PRODUCTION_ADD_PCT. Rosetta Fragments → GLOBAL_MULT + UNLOCK + initial GRANT of translated cognates in new dialect. The language model is a Subsystem with SimulationProxy that estimates average word-translation rate and root-discovery cadence.

**Risk Assessment**: Closest anti-pattern risk: front-loaded if most words are easy to translate early (violating "distribute unlocks throughout timeline"). Mitigation: words have exponentially increasing translation costs based on linguistic complexity (common trade words cheap, abstract philosophical terms expensive, encrypted texts very expensive). Root discovery is spaced throughout each excavation. Narrative revelations are tied to late-game translations, ensuring there's always something to look forward to. Risk that the conlang needs to be deep enough to sustain the mechanic — needs at minimum ~200 words across all excavations with consistent etymological relationships.
